# python-challenge

I have three folders in this repository
- One with the resources named "Starter_Code"
- One named "Pybnak" with the results of the first part of the challenge
- One named "PyPoll" with the results of the second part of the challenge

## PyBank Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
  - The total number of months included in the dataset
  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyPoll Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
  - The total number of votes cast
  - A complete list of candidates who received votes
  - The percentage of votes each candidate won
  - The total number of votes each candidate won
  - The winner of the election based on popular vote
